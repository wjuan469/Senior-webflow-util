# Overview

Data makes your website interesting. 

Webflow's CMS and Collection Lists offer some great capabilities but they also have limitations-

- Inability to display data in a table
- Limitations on nesting colleciton lists
- Inability to populate an element's custom attributes with data from a Collection List

WFU enables new ways for you to access and integrate data into your Webflow site- both from the Webflow CMS, and from external sources such as public APIs.

Capabilities are divided into two groups-

Creating JSON data sources;

- Turning a Webflow CollectionList into a usable Data source
- Turning a remote JSON or CSV resource into a usable Data source

Data-binding Webflow elements to those sources;

- Binding lists to FORM Dropdown elements, as select options
- Binding lists to FORM Text elements, as autocomplete options

## What can you do? 

- Display the count of items in a datasource



## How it Works

WFU **data sources** are simple JSON arrays built from Collection Lists that you prepare. These are stored in a Map collection that I refer database, which enables you to retrieve multiple data sources
