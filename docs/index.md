# What is WFU?

This library is a collection of utilities that add capability to 
[Webflow](https://webflow.com/)
sites. It focuses on overcoming certain limitations of Webflow, and adding certain functionality.

Some of the most popular features include;

- Data-binding form INPUT and SELECT elements to your collection lists
- Adding custom attributes dynamically to elements within a collection list.
- Adding tables support, with data sourced from Google Sheets
- Multilingual support through language-detection and a dynamic content-switcher

All of these features are focused on creating as much capability within Webflow as possible, without relying on 3rd party plug-ins and monthly service fees.

This project is also a practical exploration into the use of Javascript ES6 modules, NPM, and other state-of-the art web dev technologies, and how they can be used to enhance Webflow sites.

*This library will be expanded as needed, and broken into modules for convenient selection of the parts you need.*

## What's New?

### Redesigned Using ES6 Modules

*3.0 is a complete redesign using Javascript ES6-style modules.*

Without the ability to use NPM, javascript modules appear to be the most effective way
to separate and re-use use code between the libraries.

*Note, I'm using the `.js` extension on our modules rather than `.ejs`, 
as this currently appears to be the recommended practice. However, these are ES6 modules, so you will need to specify that in your script references.*

If you're unfamiliar with ES6 modules, accessing them looks like this;

Let's suppose you want to call `myFunc()` from your Webflow page. In the "Before /BODY" code area, you might include this;

```
<script type="module">
    import { myFunc } from 'some-wfu-library.js';
    $(function () {
        myFunc();
    }
</script>
```

Notes;

- The `type="module"` on the `<script>` element is important, to allow ES6 use in your script.
- Modules are included through `import`, where you specify the function(s) you want to access, and the path to the `.js` library.
- You can use other javascript and jQuery 100% as normal.

I'll give specific examples of script you can use with each library.

### Separation of Functionality

As the library grows, I found the need to partition the code better for accessibility & reusability. 

- Webflow-specific code is being distinguished from more general functionality.
- Libraries specific to Webflow implementation are prefixed with `webflow-`.
- Other libraries will be named, grouped and prefixed according to the functional intent
and the platforms they pertain to.
- This means that much of the functionality here can be used in non-Webflow sites, or in sites that you are hosting separately. Around that capability is a Webflow-specific wrapper that applies those features in Webflow's unique HTML-generation and hosting-environment context.

### 3 Distinct Integration Approaches

I want to embrace the reality that many Webflow designers are unfamiliar with programming,
while others need maximum functionality.

To support a wide range of users, I'm conceptually dividing integration approaches into 3 zones;

- **Code.** *Programmers* will generally use the libraries under `src/modules` directly. 
These functions and libraries can be arranged to accomplish complex tasks with unique configurations, and using these modules directly gives you full access to their capabilities.

- **Lo-Code.** *Designers* with basic scripting knowledge are provided with *locode* libraries that
encapsulate the most commonly-used functionality into single function calls.
These libraries exist under `/src/locode` and have a `-helper` suffix. These will provide the core functionality of the full libraries, with minimal setup.

- **No-Code.** Where possible, I intend to offer codeless possibilities where the functionality is automatically added by simply adding the library. Paste in the library refernce, tag your elements for the functionality you want, and everything else happens automatically. This entirely avoids script-writing, while giving you much of the functionality designers want.

## Using Webflow Data

`webflow-data.js` is a simple **databinding utility** which is designed 
to use a Webflow Collection List as a data-source, extract data, 
and allow you to bind it in two ways;

1. To form SELECT controls ( dropdowns & listboxes ), so that users can pick from a CMS-generated list.
2. As dynamic attributes to Webflow-generated elements.

Here is a video overview of how to use `webflow-data` ( current as of v2.0 );

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc7vx7YdK5I

Notes;

- `webflow-data` works with any Collection List, filtered and sorted as you choose, so you get complete control.
- You choose what to extract and use from the Collection List, and how to name it.
- The datasource is prepared as JSON, so it is available to your other scripts as well.
- The databinding routines can then bind that to a form SELECT element.
- The example HTML is "dirty" in that it is full of Webflow markup. This demonstrates how we navigate the Webflow-generated content structures such as Collection Lists.

*Use the examples as a reference for using each feature.*

### STEP 1 - Add the Library

You can embed our library directly from the [JSDelivr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSDelivr) CDN.

In your Page *settings* (click the gear icon), add the script reference to the **Before </body> tag** section.

```
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/sygnaltech/webflow-util@latest/dist/webflow-data.min.js"></script>
```

*Note JSDelivr's [versioning](https://www.jsdelivr.com/features) support.*

We recommend that you specify the **major** and **minor** version numbers in your script reference.
Replace `@latest` with e.g. `@1.2` or the library version you want to use.

*This will protect you from breaking changes in new versions we release.*

### STEP 2 - Setup your Data Source

1. Create a Webflow `Collection List`.

    1. Bind it to the `Collection` you want.
    1. Set sorting and filtering as you want.
    1. In the Item, create an `HTML Embed` element

2. Add an `HTML Embed` element to the Collection

3. Paste the following code into the `HTML Embed`.

```
<script type="application/json" data="mydata">
{
  "id": " (your item goes here) ",
  "text": " ( text item goes here) "
}
</script>
```

4. Configure the `Embed` code as follows;

    1. set the script's `data` attribute to the name you want for your datasource. You can have create several different datasources on the same page if you like.

    1. for the `id`, use whatever **Add Field** item you want, generally `Slug` is the best field to use.

    1. for the `text`, use whatever **Add Field** item you want displayed as the text in the SELECT.

    1. Make the Collection List invisible, if you want it hidden in the designer ( this will not affect displayed output ).  If you do this, you won't see it anymore in the Webflow designer, but you can select it in the left-side Navigator.

### STEP 3 - Setup your Form

1. Add a `Form` and a `Select` element in the Webflow designer.  

1. Apply a `data-source` custom attribute, which has the same name that you've given your datasource.

### STEP 4 - Setup the Databinding

In your Page *settings* (click the gear icon), add the script reference to the **Before </body> tag** section, right after your script.


```
    <script>

        // Instantiate WebflowDataUtil object
        var webflowDataUtil = new WebflowDataUtil();

        $(function () {

            // Databind
            webflowDataUtil.dataBindAll();

        });

    </script>
```


# Options

WebflowDataUtil can be instantiated with options, as in;

```
// Instantiate MailerLiteUtil object
var webflowDataUtil = new WebflowDataUtil({
    logging: true, // enable logging to console
});
```

## `logging = true | false`

*Defaults to false.*

Enables or disables logging activity output to the console.



# Technical Notes

Sygnal's **Webflow Utilities (WFU)** is an experimental project as much as a practical toolset. 
The team developing WFU is applying the most current javascript technolgoies where possible 
as a practical implementation exercise.

### Webflow-centric Design

All of the tools in our library are designed specifically to work with websites 
that are built and hosted on Webflow.

This means;

- We prioritize HTML5 generation, with little attention to backwards compatability.

- We use jQuery, which is present in all Webflow hosted sites.

- Script files must be hosted externally to the site.

- We prioritize solutions which overcome limitations & problems in Webflow, 
even if they wouldn't be a common issue on other platforms.

### JavaScript modules

As of 3.0, WFU uses 
[JavaScript modules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules)
as a way to better define and separate code. 
These are widely supported across modern browsers, however are not supported by Internet Explorer.

### Object-Oriented patterns

For complex utility modules, our library is designed using OO patterns as much as possible.

### Node Package Manager (NPM)

Ideally, we'd like to build this toolset as a proper NPM package, 
as it would allow for much richer scripting options, a plug-in style architecture, easy script updating and dependency management.

However to our knowledge there is currently no native way to make this work with Webflow's hosting environment.
At the moment any NPM-style functionality such as the `package.json` only exist as a placeholder
for these future goals.
