# Technical Notes

**Webflow Utilities (WFU)** is an experimental project as much as a practical toolset. 
Where possible, I'm employing the latest javascript technologies as a practical implementation exercise, and to test their capabilities.

### Webflow-centric Design

All of the tools in this library are designed specifically to work with websites that are built and hosted on Webflow.

This means;

- I prioritize HTML5 generation, with little attention to backwards compatability.

- I use jQuery, which is present in all Webflow hosted sites.

- Script files are be hosted externally to the site. In-site scripting is limited to "glue" and configuration scripts.

- I'm prioritizing solutions which overcome limitations & problems in Webflow, even if they wouldn't be a common issue on other platforms.

### JavaScript modules

As of 3.0, WFU uses 
[JavaScript modules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules)
as a way to better define and separate code. 
These are widely supported across modern browsers, however are not supported by Internet Explorer.

### Object-Oriented patterns

For complex utility modules, our library is designed using OO patterns as much as possible.

### Node Package Manager (NPM)

Ideally, I'd like to evolve this toolset as a proper NPM package, as it would allow for much richer scripting options, a plug-in style architecture, version and dependency management.

At the moment this is on the backburner, as I'm unfamiliar with using NPM to generate browser-compatible ES6 bundles.
